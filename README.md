## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- .NET SDK (required to build and run the project)

### Installing

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Build the project:**
   Navigate to the root of the project directory and run:
   ```bash

3. **Run the application:**
   After building the project, move to the MelodyMine-Blazor directory and start the application with the following command:
   ```bash
   MelodyMine-Blazor/UI/ $ dotnet watch
   ```
   This will start the server and begin watching for any changes in the source code, automatically reloading the server when changes are detected.

## Running the tests

To ensure the quality and functionality of MelodyMine application, we employ a suite of tests written with xUnit. Follow these steps to execute the tests:

### Running xUnit tests

1. **Navigate to the test directory:**
   From the root of your project, change directories to the xUnit test folder:

   ```bash
   MelodyMine-Blazor/ $ cd Test
   ```
2. **Execute the tests:**
   Run the following command to execute the tests:
   ```bash
   MelodyMine-Blazor/Test/ $ dotnet test
